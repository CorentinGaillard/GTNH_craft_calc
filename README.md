There are two option for loading the recipe, which are either a csv file here on github (that does not require any logging, but might not be updated), or a google sheet (that requires you logging in a google account). Uncomment the one that you prefer

To add new recipes, modifie the copy on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xY8lWg1q8Nwm145chN9CTzGZMhrCRxYMlNVZgBhbaYM/edit?usp=sharing), and follow the format used on the main spreadsheet and then open an issue to signal that you have added recipe, so I can update the safe sheet, and the csv on github.
